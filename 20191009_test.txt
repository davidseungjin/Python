Lists and tuples qualify to be called as sequences, just like strings. The most distinguishing features of a sequence are membership tests and indexing operations. The latter allows directly fetching an item(s) from the sequence.
Python provides support for three types of sequences; lists, strings, and tuples. Each of them supports the slicing operation. It allows retrieving a particular portion of the sequence.
Dictionary
Another type of built-in data structure in Python is the dictionary. It stores data in the form of key-value pairs. The keys defined for a dictionary need to be unique. Though values in a dictionary can be mutable or immutable objects, only immutable objects are allowed for keys.
A dictionary in Python is defined using key-value pairs, separated by commas, enclosed within curly braces. The key and value are separated using a colon. The general syntax of a dictionary is:
some_dictionary = {key 1 : value 1, key 2 : value 2, key 3 : value 3,…., key n : value n}
The key-value pairs in a dictionary don’t follow any specific order. Hence, you need to sort them manually for maintaining some kind of order. Any dictionary defined in the Python programming language is an instance of the dict class.
In order to access any key-value pair, the key needs to be specified using the indexing operator. The del statement is used for deleting one or many key-value pairs from a dictionary. The in operator is there for checking whether a key-value pair exists in the dictionary or not.
The indexing operator is also used for adding a new key-value pair. Using keyword arguments in functions is much similar to using dictionaries.
Set
Simply, a set is an unordered collection of simple objects in Python. In addition to being iterable and mutable, a set has no duplicate elements. Any set defined in Python is an instance of the set class.
Compared to a list, a set is advantageous by virtue of having a highly optimized method for checking whether some element is contained in the set or not. The general syntax of a set is:
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
David david David david
